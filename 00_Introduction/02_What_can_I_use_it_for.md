## What can I use OrbitDB for?

We want to believe that any application that can be built using traditional models can be built with a peer-to-peer architecture, but overall OrbitDB excels in flexibly building complex distributed applications.

### Who is already using OrbitDB?

Perhaps the best way to answer your question of "What can I build with OrbitDB?" is by example. There are already several organizations using OrbitDB in the wild. We maintain a registry called [Awesome OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/awesome-orbitdb) with several applications and libraries built with OrbitDB. If you're looking for ideas for your own app, maybe start here.

Also, if you have a project you want to show off, [Awesome OrbitDB](https://github.com/orbitdb/awesome-orbitdb) accepts issues and pull requests.
