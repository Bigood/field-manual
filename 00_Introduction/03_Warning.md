## A Warning

OrbitDB, and the underlying IPFS layer, are currently _alpha_ software. There have already been high-severity bugs, API-breaking changes, and security disclosures ahead. This is transparently communicated, yet these warnings have done nothing at all to stop large organizations from using these tools in production. It's already out in the wild.

If that sounds bad, don't worry - it gets worse.

Not only are these tools alpha, but the **entire decentralized industry is in an alpha state**. There are unsolved problems not just technical in nature but legal, political, economic, and societal. The wave of the personal computer revolution crashed, followed by the information age. The wave of the mobile revolution left us in the social age. Now we're here in the midst of a new decentralized revolution.

You may hear claims of what type of age might follow this, but it's imposisble to tell. It's also safe to say that the world will not be ready for it. So, brace yourself. It is our hope that you find this challenging and exciting, in addition to feeling a healthy dose of trepidation and even downright horror at times.

That all being said: welcome to the distributed future, and we're excited to have you with us.
