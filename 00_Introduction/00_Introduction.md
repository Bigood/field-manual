# Introduction

## Centralized Power: The Present

Anybody that has been paying attention during the last few years has been a witness to some truly landmark events:

- GDPR
- Massive data breaches
- Facebook, elections, etc.
- IOT Data being used by insurance companies
- the devaluation of music and art
- ML Fairness

The central problem in all these cases comes from a simple asymmetry: the people that _generate_ the data do not end up _owning_ the data. This can and will be used against you: in a court of law, in your bank account balance, in your social stature and in your overall life outcome.

## How did we get here? A Historical Context

Distributed systems are nothing new, yet somehow advances in this space tend to "disrupt" more thoughougly than any VC-funded startup can ever hope to, with results that are often as tragic as they are profound.

### The Birth of the Internet

In the late 1960s, The Internet itself was developed as a decentralized system of computers capable of sustaining a nuclear attack. Individual computers became linked together via underground wire and a process known as "packet switching" was implemented to send data in disparate chunks which were expected to be re-assembled in order on the receiving end.

By the late 1980s, academic works involving distributed consensus algorithms such as Paxos were introduced. TODO: flesh out

in 1991, the first World Wide Website went live, and what is now the most popular content and user interface layer for the internet was born. The web allowed anybody with the means to publish a website and link to other sites using their location-based addresses.

Already you can see we have a distributed infrastructure, the seeds of distributed computation, and a hyperlinked data structure. This alone

### The Gig Economy

Companies now use decentralized thiBy providing a centralized platform to manage a decentralized set of assets 

### Enter the Blockchain

The publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper in October 2008, started a new renaissance in our industry. Not only did it prove out a new technology in the blockchain, but it began a new way of thinking about distributed systems in general. In addition to giving rise to a new generation of financial applications with a high degree of speculative activity, Bitcoin's underlying (and beyond computationally expensive) _proof-of-work_ algorithm gave us distributed consensus.

Thegave the industry a new focus and a new way of thinking about a critical finance. The fact that it was published by a mysterious figure, the so-called Satoshi Nakamoto, only served to mystify technologists and 

## The Way Out: Our Distributed Future 

TODO: IPFS

We would argue that cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies only laid the foundation of our distributed future. Projects like IPFS, which harness the power of directed acyclic graphs. TODO: Filecoin
