# Introduction

## Centralized Power: The Present

The last few years have been a watershed for how we collectively understand the internet, data, and our increasingly interconnected world. For instance, here are a few major events that have changed our perceptions of security, privacy, and access:

- Data stores in centralized locations has been breached time and time again in the form of government and criminal hacking, exposing the data of millions of people per attack. TODO Link all of these with real-world examples
- The Internet-of-Things has linked your behavioral and usage data directly to the headquarters of large corporations; corporations, like Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, that are so large that they are able to directly influence politics on the global scale, and are unlike anything that our society has before. This linking has in turn lead to personalization, manipulation, and exploitation to an alarming degree.
- Artists, musicians, performers, and writers alike are now able to use platforms like Spotify and Amazon to publish their work to a larger audience, but the devaluation of art and music is dire, leaving struggling artisans to compete with each other for fractions of what they made even 10 years ago.
- Historical data is now being mined and repurposed for algorithms, leading to practices such as real estate pricing and predictive policing. Only very recently has any attention been paid to the bias inherent in these data sets.
- The trend of tracking user hits has lead to many large corporations monetizing **attention** by way of harvesting and processing user data. This, when done both by major media companies (Fox News, MSNBC) and social web sites (Facebook) has wreaked its fair share of havoc in terms of society and politics.

These individual points are connected. The central problem in all these cases comes from a simple asymmetry: the people that _generate_ the data do not end up _owning_ the data. This can (and has, and will) be used against you: in a court of law, in your bank account balance, in your social structure, and in your digital and physical life.

## How did we get here? A Historical Context

Distributed systems are nothing new, yet somehow advances in this space tend to "disrupt" more thoroughly than any VC-funded startup can ever hope to, with results that are often as tragic as they are profound.

### The Birth of the Internet

In the late 1960s, The Internet itself was developed as a decentralized system of computers capable of sustaining a nuclear attack. Individual computers became linked together via underground wire and a process known as "packet switching" was implemented to send data in disparate chunks which were expected to be re-assembled in order on the receiving end.

By the late 1980s, academic works involving distributed consensus algorithms such as [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)) were introduced. TODO: flesh out

in 1991, the first World Wide Website went live, and what is now the most popular content and user interface layer for the internet was born. The web allowed anybody with the means to publish a website and link to other sites using their location-based addresses.

Already you can see we have a distributed infrastructure, the seeds of distributed computation, and a hyperlinked data structure. This alone 

### Early Peer-to-Peer Applications

### The Gig Economy

Companies now use decentralized thiBy providing a centralized platform to manage a decentralized set of assets 

### Enter the Blockchain

The publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper in October 2008, started a new renaissance in our industry. Not only did it prove out a new technology in the blockchain, but it began a new way of thinking about distributed systems in general. In addition to giving rise to a new generation of financial applications with a high degree of speculative activity, Bitcoin's underlying (and beyond computationally expensive) _proof-of-work_ algorithm gave us distributed consensus.

Thegave the industry a new focus and a new way of thinking about a critical finance. The fact that it was published by a mysterious figure, the so-called Satoshi Nakamoto, only served to mystify technologists and 

## The Way Out: Our Distributed Future 

TODO: IPFS

We would argue that cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies only laid the foundation of our distributed future. Projects like IPFS, which harness the power of directed acyclic graphs. TODO: Filecoin
