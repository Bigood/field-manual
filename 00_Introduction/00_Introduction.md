# Introduction


## Welcome to Our Distributed Future

If you are reading this book, you are likely interested in decentralization, distributed technology, or peer-to-peer networking. If you've been paying attention, the last few years preceding the writing of this text have been truly landmark in terms of privacy, data soverignty, and decentralized technologies.

- GDPR
- Massive data breaches
- Facebook, elections, etc.

As you can see, there's a lot of work to be done - not just for members of our industry but for the general public. While this work isn't purely technical - consumers will require education and agency in decentralizing themselves and their data - this text will assume that you, the reader, are technical enough to implement the concepts put forward in this book.

Whether you are a front-end developer, a back-end developer, a user experience expert, or even a technology writer or marketer, you will play a key role in advocating and implementing distributed applications in the 21st century. This means that you, yes _you_ are on the front-lines of decentralization, and _you_ be part of building our distributed future.

## Historical Context


Distributed systems are nothing new, yet somehow advances in this space tend to "disrupt" more thoughougly than any VC-funded startup can ever hope to, with results that are often as tragic as they are profound.

### The Birth of the Internet

In the late 1960s, The Internet itself was developed as a decentralized system of computers capable of sustaining a nuclear attack. Individual computers became linked together via underground wire and a process known as "packet switching" was implemented to send data in disparate chunks which were expected to be re-assembled in order on the receiving end.

By the late 1980s, academic works involving distributed consensus algorithms such as Paxos were introduced. TODO: flesh out

in 1991, the first World Wide Website went live, and what is now the most popular content and user interface layer for the internet was born. The web allowed anybody with the means to publish a website and link to other sites using their location-based addresses.

Nobody disputes that these technologies have transformed (and are still transforming) the world as we speak. However,

TODO: 1999-2004 Napster, Kazaa, etc.

### Enter the Blockchain

The publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper in October 2008, started a new renaissance in our industry. Not only did it prove out a new technology in the blockchain, but it began a new way of thinking about distributed systems in general. In addition to giving rise to a new generation of financial applications with a high degree of speculative activity, Bitcoin's underlying (and beyond computationally expensive) _proof-of-work_ algorithm gave us distributed consensus.

Thegave the industry a new focus and a new way of thinking about a critical finance. The fact that it was published by a mysterious figure, the so-called Satoshi Nakamoto, only served to mystify technologists and

We would argue that cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies only laid the foundation of our distributed future. Projects like IPFS, which harness the power of directed acyclic graphs. TODO: Filecoin
