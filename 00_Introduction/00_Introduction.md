# Introduction

Welcome to the OrbitDB Field Manual. This book serves as a technical manual to the database engine known as OrbitDB, and also provides higher-level context for peer-to-peer technologies and ways of thinking.

Please read the introduciton first and then skip ahead to the relevant part or parts that interest you. In general, Parts 1 and 3 are more technical in focus, and Parts 2 and 4 are more prosaic.

## A different perspective on centralized power

Instead of adding to the stream of discourse railing against centralized power and so-called "Big Tech," we want to offer another perspective: every technology that every company has created, and every piece of data they have stored in their silos has together provided vast opportunities for us in the decentralized space. The ziggurat of the centralized is nothing more than a pedestal and springboard for us to leap off of into a bright future filled with new products and servives as yet unimagined.

In short, everything past is prologue to this moment - and we're glad you're with us.

## Historical Context

Distributed systems are nothing new, yet somehow advances in this space tend to "disrupt" more thoroughly than any VC-funded startup can ever hope to, with results that are often as tragic as they are profound.

### The Birth of the Internet

In the late 1960s, The Internet itself was developed as a decentralized system of computers capable of sustaining a nuclear attack. Individual computers became linked together via underground wire and a process known as "packet switching" was implemented to send data in disparate chunks which were expected to be re-assembled in order on the receiving end.

By the late 1980s, academic works involving distributed consensus algorithms such as [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)) were introduced. TODO: flesh out

in 1991, the first World Wide Website went live, and what is now the most popular content and user interface layer for the internet was born. The web allowed anybody with the means to publish a website and link to other sites using their location-based addresses.

Already you can see we have a distributed infrastructure, the seeds of distributed computation, and a hyperlinked data structure. This alone 

### Early Peer-to-Peer Applications

TODO: Kleppman, etc

TODO: 1999-2004 Napster, Kazaa, etc.

### The Gig Economy

Companies now use decentralized ways of organizing their By providing a centralized platform to manage a decentralized set of assets 

### Enter the Blockchain

The publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper in October 2008, started a new renaissance in our industry. Not only did it prove out a new technology in the blockchain, but it began a new way of thinking about distributed systems in general. In addition to giving rise to a new generation of financial applications with a high degree of speculative activity, Bitcoin's underlying (and beyond computationally expensive) _proof-of-work_ algorithm gave us distributed consensus.

Thegave the industry a new focus and a new way of thinking about a critical finance. The fact that it was published by a mysterious figure, the so-called Satoshi Nakamoto, only served to mystify technologists and 

## Our distributed, decentralized future 

TODO: IPFS

We would argue that cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies only laid the foundation of our distributed future. Projects like IPFS, which harness the power of directed acyclic graphs. TODO: Filecoin

## Conclusions

If you still want to take an adversarial approach, feel free - nothing that we've written so far is incompatible with that. It may simply be a case that taking a positive approach to solving these problems will prove more fruitful, more productive, and healhier in the end.
