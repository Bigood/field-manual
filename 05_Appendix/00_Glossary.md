# Appendix I: Glossary

We use a lot of new terms in this tutorial that you may not have run across. In order to make it easier to look up what these terms are, we've added this short glossary. It also helps us to formalize what spelling or definitions we're going with - 'datastore' over 'data store', isomorphic meaning platform agnostic as opposed to just frontend vs backend, etc.

## Terms to use

* **database**:
* **datastore**:
* **isomorphic**:
