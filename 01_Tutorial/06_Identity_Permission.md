### On security

**Note:** All this being said, OrbitDB and IPFS are still _alpha software_, there have been security flaws discovered, reported, and disclosed

People can, and do, spend decades of their lives thinking about and working on securirty in all it's numerous aspects. In our case, we will approach security from three perspectives: Identity, Authorization and Identification.

### Distributed identity management

Distributed identity is still a hotly contested topic, and frankly an unsolved problem, in our industry. However, many organizations have recently lept ahead with solutions and there will be more to come. [Metamask] and its ties to the ethereum blockchain, are one.

### Authorization

### Identification
