## Connecting to the global IPFS network

You will now reconfigure your IPFS node to connect to the global network and begin _swarming_ with other peers. For more information on what this means, see Part 2 - Thinking Peer to Peer. For now, just understand that it means you're getting connected.

Luckily, all you have to do is remove some lines from the `NewPiecePlease` constructor:

```javascript
class NewPiecePlease {
  constructor (IPFS, OrbitDB) {
    this.node = new IPFS({
      EXPERIMENTAL: { pubsub: true },
      repo: "./ipfs",
    });

    /* ... */
  }
}
```

Then, when you re-run the app, you should see some messages in your console, something like:

```plain
```
