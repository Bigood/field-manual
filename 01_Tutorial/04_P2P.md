### Connecting to the global IPFS network

You will now reconfigure your IPFS node to connect to the global network and begin swarming with other peers. For more information on what this means, see Part 2 - Thinking Peer to Peer. For now, just understand that it means you're getting connected.

#### Restoring default IPFS config values

We started the tutorial offline to focus on OrbitDB's core concepts. Now you'll undo this and connect the app, properly, to the global IPFS network.

First, remove two lines from the `NewPiecePlease` constructor:

1. `preload: { enabled: false }`
2. `config: {  Bootstrap: [], Addresses: { Swarm: [] } }`

Then, add one line to leave you with something like this:

```javascript
class NewPiecePlease {
  constructor (IPFS, OrbitDB) {
    this.node = new IPFS({
      relay: { enabled: true, hop: { enabled: true, active: true } },
      EXPERIMENTAL: { pubsub: true },
      repo: "./ipfs",
    });

    /* ... */
  }
}
```

But wait... ff you were to restart the app and run this command, you would see that you still have an empty array.

```javascript
await NPP.node.bootstrap.list()
```

```plain
[]
```

> **Note:** Bootstrap peers are important because... TODO

This is because bootstrap and swarm values are persisted in your IPFS config. This is located in the filesystem in the case of node.js and in IndexedB in the case of the browser. You should not manually edit these files.

#### Restoring your default bootstrap peers

However, nothing will change yet when you run the app. What you _can_ do is run the you should see some messages in your console, something like:

To restore the default peers, like the one generated in the previous chapters, run this command _once_ to restore your default bootstrap peers.

```javascript
this.node.bootstrap.add(undefined, { default: true })
```

Running the command below gives you a colorful array of bootstrap peers, ready to be connected to.

```javascript
await NPP.node.bootstrap.list()
```

```plain

```

#### Enabling the swarm

Next, you will restore your default swarm addresses. These are adresses that your node announces itself to the world on.

In node.js, run this command. In the browser, do not - leave the swarm array blank.

```javascript
NPP.node.config.set("Addresses.Swarm", ['/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/4002', '/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4003/ws'], console.log)
```

Again, you won't have to do either of these restorations if you're starting with a fresh IPFS repo. These instructions are just included to deepen your understanding of what's going on in the stack.

Restart your app you'll see the console output confirming you're swarming. In node.js you'll see something like:

```plain
Swarm listening on /p2p-websocket-star/ipfs/QmXG8yk8UJjMT6qtE2zSxzz3U7z5jSYRgVWLCUFqAVnByM
Swarm listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4002/ipfs/QmXG8yk8UJjMT6qtE2zSxzz3U7z5jSYRgVWLCUFqAVnByM
Swarm listening on /ip4/172.16.100.191/tcp/4002/ipfs/QmXG8yk8UJjMT6qtE2zSxzz3U7z5jSYRgVWLCUFqAVnByM

Swarm listening on /p2p-circuit/ip4/172.17.0.1/tcp/4002/ipfs/QmXG8yk8UJjMT6qtE2zSxzz3U7z5jSYRgVWLCUFqAVnByM

```

and in the browser you'll see something like:

```plain
Swarm listening on /p2p-circuit/ipfs/QmWxWkrCcgNBG2uf1HSVAwb9RzcSYYC2d6CRsfJcqrz2FX
Swarm listening on /p2p-circuit/p2p-websocket-star/ipfs/QmWxWkrCcgNBG2uf1HSVAwb9RzcSYYC2d6CRsfJcqrz2FX
```

This is good, and it's OK that they're different. You're on the right track, and ready to work peer to peer connections into the application

#### What just happened

Before this, you were working offline. Now you're not. You've been connected to the global IPFS network and are ready for peer to-peer connections.

- Removing `preload: { enabled: false }` enables connection to the bottom two nodes from the above bootstrap list.
- Removing `config: {  Bootstrap: [], Addresses: { Swarm: [] } }` will prevent thie storing of empty arrays in your config files for the `Bootstrap` and `Addresses.Swarm` config keys
- `this.node.bootstrap.add(undefined, { default: true })` restores the default list of bootstrap peers, as seen above
- `NPP.node.config.set("Addresses.Swarm", ...` restores the default swarm addresses. You should have run this in node.js only
- `relay: { enabled: true, hop: { enabled: true, active: true } }` sets up a your node as a "circut relay", which means that others will be able to "hop" through your node to connect to your peers, and your node will hop over others to do the same.

> **Note:** If you experience 529 errors from the `preload.ipfs.io` servers in your console, rest assured that there is nothing wrong with your app. Those servers exist to strengthen the network and increase application performance but they are _not_ necessary. You can reinsert `preload: { enabled: false }` any time and still remain connected to the global IPFS network

### Working with peers

We realize we've been spending a lot of time in IPFS config and IPFS commands - it's understandable, since the IPFS features form the backbone of what we're doing with OrbitDB. However, let's get back to editing our `NewPieacePlease` class by creating some p2p functions:

#### Getting a list of peers

First, you'll create the `getPeers` function inside of the `NewPiecePlease` class.

```javascript
async getPeers() {
  const peers = await this.node.swarm.peers()
  return peers
}
```

You can run this in your application code:

```javascript
const peers = await NPP.getPeers()
console.log(peers.length)
```

This will console out a number close to `10`, which is the length of your bootstrap peers. This number will stay the same in the browser and increase in node.js due to the current swarming limitations of `js-ipfs`

#### Connecting to peers

Next, you'll allow your users to connect to other peers via their _multiaddresses_.

There's a number of ways to model and test this during development - you could open up two browsers, or a public and private window in the same browser. Similarly, you could run one instance of the app in node.js and the other in the browser. You should be able to connect to all.

In this book we will deal with the simplest possible scenario: two peers. They will be called simply **Peer1** and **Peer2**.

You can get the addresses that your node is publishing on via the following command:

```javascript
const id = await NPP.node.id()
console.log(id.addresses)
```

You'll see a list of addresses your node is publishing on. Expect the browser to have only 2, and node.js to have more. Since we're dealing with both node.js and the browser, we will use the addresses starting with `p2p-circut`.

You can now enable peer connection by adding this function to the `NewPiecePlease` class:

```javascript
async connectToPeer(addr) {
  async connectToPeer(multiaddr) {
  try {
    await this.node.swarm.connect(multiaddr)
    return true
  } catch(e) {
    throw (e)
    return false
  }
}
```

Finally, connect to other peers like so:

```javascript
const success = NPP.connectToPeer("/p2p-circuit/ipfs/QmWxWkrCcgNBG2uf1HSVAwb9RzcSYYC2d6CRsfJcqrz2FX")
if(success) /* do stuff */
```

#### What just happened?

You created 2 functions: one that shows a list of peers and another that lets you connect to peers via their multiaddress.

- blahblah

### Peer to peer communication via IPFS pubsub

The "pubsub" in IPFS pubsub is derived from "publish" and "subscribe" which is a common messaging model in distributed systems. You can leverage the underlying IPFS infrastructure to create a simple communication mechanism between the users of your app.

#### Subscribing to "your" channel

First, you'll add some code to allow you to subscribe to a channel. Channels have names, and in thise case you'll just use the node ID.

Update the `ready` handler in the `NewPiecePlease` constructor to look like the following:

```javascript
this.node.on("ready", async () => {
  const nodeId = await this.node.id()
  this.orbitdb = await OrbitDB.createInstance(this.node)
  this.defaultOptions = { accessController: { write: [this.orbitdb.identity.publicKey] }}

  const docStoreOptions = Object.assign(this.defaultOptions, { indexBy: 'hash' })
  this.piecesDb = await this.orbitdb.docstore('pieces', docStoreOptions)
  await this.piecesDb.load()

  this.userDb = await this.orbitdb.kvstore("user", this.defaultOptions)
  await this.userDb.load()

  await this.userDb.set('pieces', this.piecesDb.id)
  await this.userDb.set("nodeId", nodeId.id)

  await this.node.pubsub.subscribe(nodeId.id, this.onmessage)
  if (typeof this.onready === "function") this.onready()
});
```
